A resume template done purely with HTML and CSS, which can be rendered into PDF through web browser print-to-PDF functionality, making a nice, professional and ready-to-print resume See the link: https://monikapatelit.github.io/cv.pdf

As the resume is purely typeset with HTML and CSS, it's highly customizable (e.g. if you want an "summary" section, just copy-paste a few HTML elements) and all you need is a text editor and a web browser. Yea, maybe some basic CSS knowledge will do to if you want to change style.

To convert HTML to PDF, I have used https://www.sodapdf.com/html-to-pdf/ but be care full the only allow two conversion a days.
Forks, comments and suggestions are always welcome.
The layout design was inspired by Hugo theme winning
