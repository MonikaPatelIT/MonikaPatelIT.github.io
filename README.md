A resume template done purely with HTML and CSS, which can be rendered into PDF through web browser print-to-PDF functionality, making a nice, professional and ready-to-print resume See the link: https://monikapatelit.github.io/assets/monika-patel-cv.pdf

As the resume is purely typeset with HTML and CSS, it's highly customizable (e.g. if you want an "summary" section, just copy-paste a few HTML elements) and all you need is a text editor and a web browser. Yea, maybe some basic CSS knowledge will do to if you want to change style.

Forks, comments and suggestions are always welcome.
The layout design was inspired by Hugo theme winning
