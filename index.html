          We work on building amazing user experiences and software for data digitalizing. I helped carry out the top-to-bottom redesign, implementation of existing UI, and currently upgrading software written in 1985 making it more powerful. With those changes
          bring an increase of speed of ~40% and new stylish and user friendly design increased selling growth ~58% in March 2018.

          ACE taught me to surround myself with people who pushed me to my limits. The contract role alongside brilliant developers, designers, and helping marketing manager laid the foundation for my Front end development career in New Zealand. I'm grateful for
          the time I spent with these peers, whose work gave me a glimpse into the challenges.

          This summer was a rite of passage into software engineering professionalism. Tatvasoft's internship opened my eyes to exciting new fields, the customer-driven culture taught me that empathy matters so much, time well spent. Developers and designers blew
          me away with their willingness to share their time and wisdom. The trust my teammates placed in me did wonders for my confidence in writing quality software. I continue to be inspired by this company as a permanent employee.

          CHARUSAT presented unprecedented scale and diversity of opportunities. My four years of phenomenal professors across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview. My engagement in CHARUSAT's tech & innovation initiatives exercised
          my creative muscle, sparked my obsession with design, and strengthened my tolerance to adversity.
